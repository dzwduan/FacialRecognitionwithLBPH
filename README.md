# FacialRecognitionwithLBPH
Human beings perform face recognition automatically every day and practically with no effort.  Although it sounds like a very simple task for us, it has proven to be a complex task for a computer, as it has many variables that can impair the accuracy of the methods, for example: illumination variation, low resolution, occlusion, amongst other.  In computer science, face recognition is basically the task of recognizing a person based on its facial image. It has become very popular in the last two decades, mainly because of the new methods developed and the high quality of the current videos/cameras.
